## Why are there 2 different apps
The original app was published to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. While the cost of maintaining developer licenses are not high, there is a small cost. Since the app is completely free and without ads, paying for the license doesn't make any sense. Unfortunately, there is no way to continue publishing to the app stores without a license so Sharp Cooking was rewritten using web technologies which can also be installed in many devices.

For more details, see the blog post [Rewriting SharpCooking from Xamarin to PWA - Part 1](https://lpains.net/posts/2023-01-01-rewriting-sharp-cooking-app-part-1/).

## Can I keep using the older app?
No, the original app is deprecated and will be removed from the app stores. Please use the new app.
