description: How to share recipes as text or files
---

There are two primary ways of sharing your recipes: text and file.

## Sharing as text
This is the simplest option to share your recipe. You can simply text your recipe to anyone else or save it to a text file. This option does not share the recipe images and cannot be directly imported into Sharp Cooking.

## Sharing as file
{{< hint type=tip >}}
Backing up your recipes or sharing them use the same approach in Sharp Cooking. This gives you the ability to take a backup in Settings page and send the generated file to a friend or family.

Using this method, you share a file that can be imported directly in Sharp Cooking. The file includes everything about a recipe including the images associated to it.

## Receiving a shared file
See [backup](/web/backup) for details on how to restore a shared file.

## Sharing via share code
{{< hint type=warning >}}
By using the feature, you agree to the terms defined in the [Privacy Policy](/web/privacy-policy).
{{< /hint >}}

Using this method, you can share a recipe without having to send it as text or file. This method is useful when you want to share a recipe with someone who is using Sharp Cooking. The recipient can import the recipe directly into Sharp Cooking using the cloud code.
