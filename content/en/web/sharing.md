There are two primary ways of sharing your recipes: text and file.

## Sharing as text
This is the simplest option to share your recipe. You can simply text your recipe to anyone else or save it to a text file. This option does not share the recipe images and cannot be directly imported into Sharp Cooking.

## Sharing as file

Backing up your recipes or sharing them use the same approach in Sharp Cooking. This gives you the ability to take a backup in Settings page and send the generated file to a friend or family.

Using this method, you share a file that can be imported directly in Sharp Cooking. The file includes everything about a recipe including the images associated to it.

## Receiving a shared file
