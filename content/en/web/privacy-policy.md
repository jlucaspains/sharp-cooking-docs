By using this app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with the policy defined below.

Sharp Cooking is designed to not use any of your personal information. All data you input into the app is kept on your device unless you share it using, Apple iOS sharing, Google Android sharing, or Cloud Share capabilities.

If you choose to use Cloud Share, a copy of the shared recipe is stored on the Microsoft Azure cloud in the United States geopolitical region for a maximum of one hour. After this time, the data is automatically deleted. The only identifier stored with the recipe is a unique code that is used to import the recipe into Sharp Cooking. Whether you choose to use Cloud Share or not, Sharp Cooking does not collect personally identifiable information.

Sharp Cooking leverages an API application for downloading recipes from websites, processing images, and processing backups. Any user data submitted is only processed in memory and never stored in any server or storage.

If you have privacy concerns related to Sharp Cooking's usage of data, please email [Sharp Cooking support](mailto:lpains.wp@gmail.com).
