## Creating a backup to keep your recipes safe
Sharp Cooking was designed for privacy, therefore, all of your data is only available in your device. In the interest of ensuring you remain in control of your data, Sharp Cooking does not automatically backup your recipes. Instead, you need to use the Backup feature in the Settings page, it will trigger an iOS or Android file save and allow you to select your favorite file store provider such as ICloud Drive, Dropbox, and Google Drive.

## Restoring a backup

{{< hint type=caution >}}
if successful, the restore will replace all existing recipes with the ones in the backup file.
{{< /hint >}}

In case you made any mistake or something is wrong with your recipes, you can use the Restore feature in the Settings page to restore your last backup. A valid backup is a zip file created by the Sharp Cooking app. When you choose this option, it will ask you to choose which file provider and file to use. That's it. That's it. Your full recipe book will be restored.
