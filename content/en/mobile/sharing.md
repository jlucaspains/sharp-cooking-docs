The basic share functionality only shares the recipe text. While that is nicely formatted, it does not allow for easily importing the recipe directly into Sharp Cooking. Now, you can finally share recipes including ingredients, Step-by-step instructions, and picture. Sharing is as easy as it gets, from the recipe display, select the ellipsis button and select share recipe as file option. Depending on the platform, you may have different options to share. Regardless of how you choose to share, as long as the recipient can receive a .zip file and they have Sharp Cooking installed, it will work. We do, however, have a few suggestions below.

## Sharing whole recipes from Android to Android
Use the Android Beam, Whatsapp, or email.

## Sharing whole recipes from iOS to iOS
Use the Air Drop, Whatsapp, or email.

## Sharing whole recipes from iOS to Android or vice-versa
Use Whatsapp or email.

## Receiving whole recipes
Receiving is even easier than sharing. Whichever file sharing platform you choose, you have only to open the .zip file received and choose Sharp Cooking as the app to open it.

## Duplicating recipes (tip)
If you ever wanted to duplicate a recipe and make modifications to the copy, you can now do that by leveraging the Share Recipe feature. Share the recipe and choose Sharp Cooking and the recipe will be automatically duplicated. Simple like that.

## Sharing your whole recipe book (tip)
Backing up your recipes or sharing them use the same approach in Sharp Cooking. This gives you the ability to take a backup in Settings page and send the generated file to a friend or family (because nobody would share cooking secrets with anyone else, right?).
