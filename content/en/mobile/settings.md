### Choosing between decimal or fractions
Some people like decimals like 1.5 and other people prefer fractions like 1 and 1/2. Regardless of preference, Sharp Cooking can show your recipe ingredient quantities just right. Just tap this feature in the Settings page to toggle between the two modes.

### Setting the default time between steps
Each step in the cooking process takes some time, from gathering ingredients, to prep and actual time in an oven, flame, fridge... You get the idea. The primary difference between Sharp Cooking and other apps is its timeline-based display. To that end, Sharp Cooking assign 5 minutes by default between steps where time information (e.g. "bake for 30 min") is not given. You can adjust this time in the Settings page. Note that any value provided is treated as minutes.
