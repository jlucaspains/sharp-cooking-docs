## Manually

Creating or adjusting a recipe is as simple as it gets. Sharp Cooking's simplicity demand that we only have the absolutely required fields: Image, Title, Source, Ingredients, Instructions, and Notes. There are, however, a few conventions that will help your recipes look and work the best within Sharp Cooking:

1. Start each ingredient with a number followed by a unit of measure. e.g.: 5 grams salt
2. Separate ingredients by a new line
3. Keep ingredient description short. Use the notes fields for any lengthy description or explanation
4. Separate instructions by a new line. This is important so that Sharp Cooking will show each step in the timeline correctly
5. When denoting time in instructions use the following syntax where x is a number: x min; x minute; x minutes; x hour; x hours; x day; x days
